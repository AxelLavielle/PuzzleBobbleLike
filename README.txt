How to read the code:

All the scripts are positionned in the Assets/Scripts folder.
The gameplay scripts are:
- Ball.cs, handling the ball behaviors.
- Launcher.cs, handling the launcher and the connection between the balls and the map.
- Map.cs, handling the behavior of the map.

The animations scripts are the following
- Arrow.cs, handling the animation and rotation of the arrow (real animation)
- Particles.cs, handling the particles effects on the ball pop (particles using)
- level2.cs, handling the level2 effect (scripted animation)
I decided to use the three way to deal with animations in order to have more knowledge on each way.

The UI scripts:
- MyUI.cs, handling the menu
- Score.cs, handling the score

How to compile and run:
In order to compile the code, use unity and use the "build and run" feature.
To play, use the arrow keys: left and right to move the angle of fire, up to fire.
